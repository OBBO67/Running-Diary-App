# Running-Diary-App

Personal project to develop a running diary application (hopefully come up with a better name) to track my progress leading up to my first marathon. The main aim of this app is to develop my web development skills.

## Initial Aims

The priority initially will be to set up the backend using node.js, express and mongodb. The backend will have the following capabilities:

- Registration (adding new users to the DB)
- Login (retrieving user profiles from the DB)
- Add training blocks (added to the user in DB)
- Add runs to DB (Workouts, Long runs, recovery runs, etc)
- Add user profile picture (held under user in the DB)
- Search profiles (Search the DB using approximate string matching method)

Registering will create a user in the DB. Once registered the user can create their profile. The profile will then be added to the DB and associated with that user. The user can then add traning blocks and runs to their profile.

The styling of the website will take a backseat until a decent bit of the backend capabilities has been implemented. Basic styling will be added as required to make the web app functional.

Bare with me as this project will constantly change as I learn more and new ideas pop into my head.

## Future Aims

Initially using bootstrap 4 for the frontend styling of the website to at least keep it looking respectable, but I am aiming to create my own using flexbox.

Add analytics to runs such as the trending of workout performances. This will be done using D3.js.

More as I come up with them.
